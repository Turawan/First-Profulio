            <p>When I entered college as an IT student, I was both excited and nervous. Iâ€™ve always been curious about how computers, websites, and mobile apps work, but I never had deep knowledge about programming or networking before. The first few months were challenging because I had to adjust to new subjects like Computer Programming, Data Structures, Networking Fundamentals, and Database Management. One of the most memorable experiences I had was building my first simple program using C++. At first, I struggled with understanding syntax errors and logic flow, but after countless hours of practicing, I finally managed to create a working project. That small achievement gave me confidence and made me realize that persistence is key in IT.</p>
